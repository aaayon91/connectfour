# Connect Four
### Connect Four is a two player game in which each player alternately places chips on a vertical board. The board itself is composed of 7 columns and 6 rows. Each player has their own colored chips. In this game, the players job is to drop their chips into the columns of their choosing with the ultimate goal of achieving a line of four linearly connected pieces to win the game.
